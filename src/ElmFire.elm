References are constructed with the function `location`, `sub`,
`parent` and by running the `open` task.

`queryId` can be used to correlate the response to the corresponding query.

{-| Actually open a reference and give an internal representation of that reference.

It's generally not necessary to explicitly open a constructed reference.
It can be used to check the reference and to cache Firebase references.

The task fails if the refence construct is invalid.

The task completes with `()` when
synchronization to the Firebase servers has completed.
The task may result in an error if the ref is invalid
or you have no permission to write this data.
-}

{-| Delete a Firebase location.

The task completes with `()` when
synchronization to the Firebase servers has completed.
The task may result in an error if the ref is invalid
or you have no permission to remove this data.
-}

{-| Query a Firebase location.

(This early version of ElmFire only supports simple value queries,
without ordering and filtering.)

On success the task returns a QueryId,
which can be used to match the corresponding responses
and to cancel the query.

The query results are reported via the signal `responses`.
